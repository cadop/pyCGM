# Filtering
def butter_filter(data, cutoff_frequency, sampling_frequency):
    """Applies a fourth order Butterworth filter.

    Fourth order Butterworth filter to be used in filt() and filter_mask_nans()
    functions, which are in Utilities. Filter is applied forward and backwards
    with the filtfilt() function -- see Notes for more details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : 1darray or list
        Data to be filtered.
    cutoff_frequency : int
        Desired cutoff frequency.
    sampling_frequency : int
        Sampling frequency signal was acquired at.

    Returns
    -------
    1darray
        1D numpy array of the signal after applying the filter.

    Notes
    -----
    Applying the filter one way will create a phase shift of the output
    signal compared to the input signal. For a 2nd order filter, this will
    be 90 degrees. Thus, filtfilt applies the signal once forward and once
    backward, which is referred to as phase correction. Whilst this brings
    the net phase shift to zero, it also means the cutoff of the filter will
    be twice as sharp when compared to a single filtering. In effect, a 2nd
    order filter applied twice will be a 4th order filter. We can apply a
    correction factor to the cuttoff frequency to compensate. Correction
    factor C = square root of 2 to the power of 1/n - 1, where n is equal to
    the number of passes.
