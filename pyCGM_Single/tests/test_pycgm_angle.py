        This test provides coverage of the getPelangle function in pyCGM.py,
        defined as getPelangle(axisP,axisD) where axisP is the proximal axis and axisD is the distal axis

        getPelangle takes in as input two axes, axisP and axisD, and returns in degrees, the Euler angle
        rotations required to rotate axisP to axisD as a list [alpha, beta, gamma]. getPelangle uses the YXZ
        order of Euler rotations to calculate the angles. The rotation matrix is obtained by directly comparing
        the vectors in axisP to those in axisD through dot products between different components
        of each axis. axisP and axisD each have 3 components to their axis, x, y, and z. 
        The angles are calculated as follows:

        .. math::
            \[ \beta = \arctan2{((axisD_{z} \cdot axisP_{y}), \sqrt{(axisD_{z} \cdot axisP_{x})^2 + (axisD_{z} \cdot axisP_{z})^2}}) \]

            \[ \alpha = \arctan2{((axisD_{z} \cdot axisP_{x}), axisD_{z} \cdot axisP_{z})} \]

            \[ \gamma = \arctan2{((axisD_{x} \cdot axisP_{y}), axisD_{y} \cdot axisP_{y})} \]

        This test calls pyCGM.rotmat() to create axisP with an x, y, and z rotation defined in the parameters.
        It then calls pyCGM.getHeadangle() with axisP and axisD, which was created with no rotation in the x, y or z
        direction. This result is then compared to the expected result. The results from this test will be in the
        YXZ order, meaning that a parameter with an inputed x rotation will have a result with the same angle in
        the z direction. The exception to this is x rotations. An x rotation of 90, 30, -30, 120, -120, 180
        degrees results in a -90, -30, 30, -6, 60, 0 degree angle in the y direction respectively. A x rotation or
        120, -120, or 180 also results in a 180 degree rotation in the x and z angles.
